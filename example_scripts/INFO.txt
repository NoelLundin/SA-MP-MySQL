- these two scripts are gamemodes
- both of them do the same, the only difference is HOW they do it
- one uses the cache functions, the other one the orm system
- both of these plugins need the Whirlpool plugin to run (http://forum.sa-mp.com/showpost.php?p=230503&postcount=1)
- feel free to use these scripts like you want
- don't forget to edit the MySQL configuration in the gamemodes
- the gamemodes automatically create the correct table(s)
